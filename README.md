# TurboXGTS-Items-Deluxe
A port of/successor to my 4 year-old mod, hopefully fixed up, improved, and always 100% working every time (or your money back guaranteed!)
(Credit to Nevernamed like... 4 years ago for the Beamstone sprite. If it's even called Beamstone by the time this gets a proper release. Or exists in the first place)
Also there will be JoJo references and I am not sorry.
